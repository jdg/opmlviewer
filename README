OPMLViewer 1.0b1

This is a test application for an open source (BSD license) OPML class for Cocoa.

More about OPML: http://www.opml.org/

OPML.h and OPML.m are, of course, included.

There's no documentation yet on using this class, but it's pretty simple, and the app shows how to use it.

This class is used as part of NetNewsWire:
